Project Instructions:

This project implements a simple API server in Java using the Spark framework to expose TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) functionality.
Usage:

    Building the Project:
        Clone the project repository to your local machine.
        Ensure you have Java SE 8 or higher installed.
        Use any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) to open the project, or use command-line tools like Maven or Gradle to build the project.

    Starting the API Server:
        Run the TOTPApi class with the main method. This will start the API server on port 4567.

    Accessing the API:
        Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints using an HTTP client or a web browser.

    API Endpoints:
        GET /totp: Retrieves the class object of the TOTP class. This endpoint demonstrates a basic usage of the Spark framework.

Dependencies:

    Java SE 8 or higher
    Spark Framework

Running Tests:

This project does not include tests for the API server. However, you can manually test the API endpoints using an HTTP client or a web browser.
